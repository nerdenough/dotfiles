# Dotfiles

This repository contains all of my dotfiles for my local environments.

## Installation

The install script copies all the config files from this repository into their
correct locations. This will **delete** all of the original files first.

_Note: Some of the config locations are macOS specific. YMMV._

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:nerdenough/dotfiles.git
cd ./dotfiles

# Copy the config
./install.sh
```
